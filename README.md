  <p>Pre-Processing Pipeline for Invoices</p>
</h3>


This repo implements document preprocessing for invoices.

## Developer Quick Start

* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended
	* Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.
		* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`
	  * `pyenv install 3.8.15`
  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).

  * Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `invoices`:

	`pyenv  virtualenv 3.8.15 invoices` <br />
	`pyenv activate invoices`

* Run `make install`
* Start a local jupyter notebook server with `make run-jupyter` <br />
	**OR** <br />
	just start the fast-API locally with `make run-web-app`

#### Extracting Relevant Information from Invoices

To retrieve various elements from an invoice, post the image to the `/invoices` API. You can try this out by starting the API locally with `make run-web-app`. Then from the base folder, run:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/invoices/v0.1.0/invoices' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'files=@sample-docs/000d40dd-2812.png' | jq -C . | less -R
```

### Generating Python files from the pipeline notebooks

You can generate the FastAPI APIs from your pipeline notebooks by running `make generate-api`.
